Using $ traceroute amplab.berkeley.edu:
[pjloury@udp084517uds ~/Dropbox/mtm/info253/webarch2013]$ traceroute amplab.berkeley.edu
traceroute to www-research2.cs.berkeley.edu (128.32.37.248), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets

 We can see from the return that the urls stay within the berkeley.edu network and therefore
 do not have to ever leave in order to access the web-page amplab.berkeley.edu
