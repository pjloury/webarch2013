1. Experiences Prior:
    I'm a UCSD Alum and I got to take an HCI class with Jim Hollan.
    The web portion taught us JS/CSS/HTML

    Since then I worked a summer internship at Basis Science, a 
    health gadget startup making a fitness tracking watch.

    At Basis, I was a Python developer and worked with a Django
    framework and did data visualization work using D3

    This summer, I've been teaching myself Ruby on Rails

    What I'd really like to learn about is interfacing the 
    web with mobile applications and really get the MVC 
    concept down, and learn may way around the DOM.

    I'd like to learn about Angular.js, Backbone.js, Node.js and 
    how to send data between a web server and a mobile application


2. Favorite Features from Chrome
    a) type directly into the browser bar to perform google search
    b) if you type crunchbase.com and then a space, you can perform a 
    direct search on the crunchbase database to save yourself some time
    c) TabCloud! Lets you save windows full of tabs for later!

   Favorite Features from Firefox
   a) Technically Chrome does this too but command+option+left/right 
   can navigate you between tabs without using the mouse
   b) You can put different skins on your browser using add-ons to 
   customize the appearance
