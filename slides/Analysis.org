* *Analysis* :slide:

* Overview :slide:
  + What can you do with data?
  + How?
** Details :notes:
   + Types of models
   + Simple stats
   + MapReduce for homework

* Types of Models :slide:animate:
  + Recommenders
  + Classifiers
  + Regressions
  + Outliers
** Some examples :notes:
   + Question: how are models used in the real world?
   + Amazon or Netflix style recommendations based on prior history
   + Spam/Ham for email, also clustering and discovering classifications
   + Guessing the price of a house (Zillow or Redfin)
   + find anomalous transactions, eg. finding fraud for credit cards

** Simple to Sophisticated :slide:two_col:
[[file:img/iceberg11.jpg]]
   + Thousands of ways to calculate a model
   + Combinatorially more ways to combine them
   + In technique, large amount of overlap between purpose
** Survey :notes:
   + ML and DM fields churn these models out
   + Newest methods combine multiple models (boosting & bagging)
   + If you want to learn more, we'll cover some of this in Data Mining
   + We're just going to go over the most well known model for each type
   + In general, this is the right way to approach it: start very simple, get
     sophisticated in order to correct for specific problems in your domain

* Recommenders :slide:animate:
  + Popularity
  + Collaborative Filter
** Simple :notes:
   + For all of these, start simple
   + If I told you the homework was a recommender system, and you could make it
     as simple as you'd like, what technique would you use?
   + Amazon Personalization team: just recommend Harry Potter
   + Next step: Collaborative Filter
   + What do people who are similar to you like?

** Collaborative Filter :slide:two_col:
   1. Find people similar you
   1. Find what they like
   1. Recommend new items to you


   1. Find items you've liked
   1. Find similar items to those
   1. Recommend new items to you
** Details :notes:
   + In general, challenge is being specific about words
   + What does it mean to be similar to you?
     + Bought the same stuff
     + Is a friend
     + Same demographic
   + What does it mean to be similar to an item?
     + Bought by same people
     + Same category
     + Similar description
       + What does it mean to have a similar description?

* Classifiers :slide:two_col:animate:
[[file:img/viagra-spam-email-message.jpg]]
  + Spam/Ham decision
  + Existence of word (eg. Viagra)
  + Now what about V1agraa?
  + Naive Bayes classifier
** Simple :notes:
   + Again, what would you do right now?
   + Check for spammy words
   + How do you keep learning the words that are spammy?
   + Is "Russian" spammy? Maybe only for some people?

** Naive Bayes :slide:
[[file:img/bayes-theorem.png]]
   + Probability of spam given it contains Viagra (W)
   + Probability of spam * probability of that word given spam
   + Over probability of that word in either
** Probabilities :notes:
   + We're not going to say /for sure/ spam or not, just calculate the
     probability
   + Learn that probability based on past examples
   + Intuition: if Viagra is always showing up in spammy mail, a new mail with
     Viagra is likely to be spam
   + Lots of logical problems with Naive Bayes, but in practice, works quite
     well

* Definitions :slide:
  + Class :: Group or type that an item belongs to
  + Feature :: An extractable property of an item that may be useful in
    classification. aka Signal
  + Label :: True class or property of an item
  + Training Set :: Items that have been labeled
** Examples :notes:
   + Class :: Spam/Ham
   + Feature :: "contains word Viagra", "was purchased by Sally"
   + Label :: Clicking "Spam" button in Gmail
   + Training Set :: All of the email you've clicked Spam/Not Spam

** Housing Example :slide:
  + Class :: Customer likes it or not
  + Features :: Price, city, square footage, # bed/bath
  + Label :: Like/Don't Like
  + Training Set :: Houses customer has toured or bid
*** Setup :notes:
   + Let's say you're Redfin trying to recommend a house to a customer
   + Class :: Customer likes it
   + Features :: Price, city, square footage, # bed/bath
   + Label :: Like/Don't Like
   + Training Set :: Houses customer has toured or bid

* Regression Analysis :slide:
  + Estimate the /price/ of the house
  + Model the relationship of all the features to the outcome
  + In general, features are numbers, estimate is a number
[[file:img/sqft-price.png]]
** Calculation :notes:
   + In general want to minimize the space between the points and the line
   + Like in the case of Yelp reviews, may need different formulas to draw lines
   + Numbers in, number out
   + So "city" may not be a good feature for regression, but what could you
     replace it with?
     + Average price of home in city
   + And what would the training set be?

* *Calculation* :slide:
** Switch Gears :notes:
   + Let's talk about how models and analysis are done

* Tools :slide:
  + Languages :: Matlab Python R SQL
  + Tools :: Unix MySQL ReST scikit-learn
  + Paradigms :: Single-Threaded Concurrent MapReduce
** Details :notes:
   + Languages are in alphabetical order. Real order depends on what you like,
     what you're doing, interfacing with, etc.
   + Unix tools like =less= =wget= =head= =cut=
   + scikit-learn machine learning Python library
   + Single-Threaded, what you're used to when running a single program
   + How do you split up a task, eg. extracting all of the features from items?
   + Concurrent programs trickier, many processes are happening at once. Track
     shared state.
   + MapReduce is what we'll focus on, widely used in industry, buys you a lot
     of scalability, structured way to think about a problem

* MapReduce :slide:
  + Map :: Extract a property to summarize over
  + Reduce :: Summarize all items with a particular propery


  + Simple: Each operation stateless
** Reading :notes:
   + Reading this week includes a video explaining MapReduce much more generally
   + This lecture will focus on it from a practical standpoint for homework
   + MapReduce's main benefits are for running over many machine, fault
     tolerance
   + But we'll just practice on one machine

** Example :slide:
   + URL Shortener
   + How many actions have we seen?
   + Redirects: 200, Saves: 40, Loads: 60
*** Details :notes:
   + Redirects :: How many times have we expanded a short link to a long one?
   + Saves :: How many times have we saved a new URL?
   + Loads :: How many times have we just loaded the front page?
   + First :: So first step in MapReduce is what?

** Map :slide:
   + Input :: Key, Value
   + Output :: Keys, Values

** Map Example :slide:
   + Input Key :: Log line number
   + Input Value :: Log line text
   + Output Key :: Action
   + Output Value :: times this action has occurred on this line
*** Counts :notes:
   + Log line number is not helpful in our specific case
   + Log line text: we hope it is machine readable so we can accurately extract
     the action
   + It has datetime, cookie, action, etc.
   + How many times has this action occurred? 1

** Status? :slide:
#+begin_src text
load		1
save		1
redirect	1
redirect	1
load		1
redirect	1
load		1
save		1
redirect	1
#+end_src
*** Middle Step :notes:
   + From log lines, we've extracted the information out that we care about
   + The counts and the actions
   + Next step summarize
   + Next step after Map?

** Reduce :slide:
   + Input :: Key, Values
   + Output :: Keys, Values
*** Value*s* :notes:
   + Note: The input is values! Plural
   + Because we get a key and all of its associated values
   + Remind me: what are we trying to get out of this computation?
   + So what do you think the output keys are?
   + Values?

** Reduce Example :slide:
   + Input Key :: Action
   + Input Values :: Counts: =[1,1,1,1]=
   + Output Key :: Action
   + Output Value :: Total Count
*** Details :notes:
   + Action is *one of* load save redirect
   + To get total count, sum all of the counts

** Example Output :slide:
   + Output Key :: Action
   + Output Value :: Total Count
#+begin_src html
"redirect"  4
"save"      2
"load"      3
#+end_src

* Point? :slide:
  + A lot of work for counting!
  + More complex calculations can be done this way, eg. PageRank
  + Stateless constraint means it can be used across thousands of computers
** Details :notes:
   + By only looking at keys and values, can optimize a lot of backend work
   + Where to send the results?
   + What to do when a computer fails? (Just restart failed part)

** Implementation :slide:
#+begin_src text
load		1
save		1
redirect	1
redirect	1
load		1
redirect	1
load		1
save		1
redirect	1
#+end_src
** Intermediate :notes:
   + This was the situation after map
   + Keys all jumbled
   + What Hadoop does is sort them and distribute them to computers

** "Shuffle" :slide:
#+begin_src text
load		1
load		1
load		1
redirect	1
redirect	1
redirect	1
redirect	1
save		1
save		1
#+end_src
** Distribute :notes:
   + Now it is easy to distribute, and can handle all the =load= at once

** Inputs :slide:
   + MapReduce distributes computing power by distributing input
   + Input is distributed by splitting on lines (records)
   + You cannot depend on lines being "together" in MapReduce
*** Splitting Files :notes:
   + Image you have a lot of large log files, GB each
   + You'd like to let different machines work on the same file
   + Split file down the middle, well, at least on a newline
   + Enable two separate machines to work on the parts
   + You don't know what line came before this one
   + You don't know if you will process the next line
   + Only view is this line
   + Real life slightly more complicated, but mostly hacks around this

** Incorrect Log Style :slide:
   + URL Shortener logging
#+begin_src python
    app.logger.info("Handling request for " + cookie)
    ...
    # find redirect
    ...
    app.logger.info("Redirecting to " + destination)
#+end_src
    + Ability to associate the redirect with the
      cookie?
      + eg. which cookie had the most redirects?
*** No! :notes:
    + Must log everything on same line
    + One machine could have the "Handling request.." Another could have
      "Redirecting to..."
    + Collect it all, then log it

** Correct Log Style :slide:
   + Logging once
#+begin_src python
    log_data['cookie'] = cookie
    ...
    # find redirect
    log_data['action'] = 'redirect'
    app.logger.info(json.dumps(log_data))
#+end_src
