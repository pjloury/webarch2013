* Project: URL shortener :slide:
  + Demo: [[http://bitly.com][bitly]]
  + This project is simpler

* Project Overview :slide:
  + Teams of up to *4*
  + You may switch teams, but not recommended
  + Part 2: Get creative! Implement product ideas

* Dates :slide:
  + Oct 31st: Part 1 due
  + Nov 14th: Optional Part 2 Proposal
  + Dec 12th: Technical report due
  + Dec 13th: Class presentation

** Part 2 Details :slide:
   + # of people ~= # of features
   + Features should be comprehensive
   + Features should be web related
   + Evaluation on end-user criteria (including delight)
** Heuristics :notes:
   + Roughly same number of features as number of people
   + But do not simply just split up the work
   + Because your features need to be cross compatible
   + If you make the site mobile compatible, then all pages should be
   + Don't spend 2 weeks in photoshop making an awesome background
   + If you do a data mining compoenent, it needs to be related to web
     activity, or inform the web interface (maybe recommendations?)
   + Evaluated: do your forms work, is the page semantic to enable
     accessability, is the interface pleasent to use, is it useful?

** Some Ideas :slide:
   + Automatically choose short path
   + Use the same short path for existing URLs
   + User sign-in
   + Mobile interface
   + REST interface
   + Recommendation system
** Additions :notes:
   + OK to generate some data for ML related features

* Proposal :slide:
  + What features will you complete?
  + Roughly how they will work
  + What you anticipate main challenge to be
  + Include all team member names
** Details :notes:
   + Work: mostly from an end-user perspective
   + Challenges: so I understand where the team is. Ideally you're exploring
     an area in which you have less experience
