    + How many links that were added before 2013-10-14 have fewer than 40 hits?
  + =INSERT=
    + Insert your own URL with a date before 2013-10-14 with greater than 40
      hits.
    + Is it possible that someone querying the database at the same time could
      see your insert partially complete (eg. only see some fields filled in)?
      What database property is this related to?
  + =UPDATE=
    + Increment the =hit_count= for only your new row. What is the new count?

* MySQL Documentation :slide:
  + Lots of options
  + OK to ask for help, but ask in general terms
  + "How can I combine constraints?"
  + Not "How can I search before X and fewer Y?"
