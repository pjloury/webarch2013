* *Data* :slide:

* The Web is Used by Humans :slide:two_col:
  + Tool used to improve the lives of users
  + How to improve the tools we have?
  + Understand their use and their users
[[file:img/fight-for-users.png]]

* Understanding :slide:
  + Collect
  + Interperate
  + Understand
** Path to Understanding :notes:
   + Collect data on the tool's usage: what features are used, what time of day,
     for what purpose?
   + Collect data on the user: ultimate goal, knowledge of problem space
   + Find patterns, develop a story
   + Have a mental model of who your users are and why they are using your tool
   + This is the way the brain works in general: build a mental model of the
     world around you so you can anticipate how things will work out

* Big Data :slide:
  + Never easier to collect data
  + Advanced analytics tools available
  + Financial incentives for understanding
[[file:img/netflix-bigcheck.jpg]]
** Modern World :notes:
   + Positive feedback: more people use web tools, more data we collect, better
     understand them, better tools, more people use the tools
   + Always need to keep in mind user's end goal though (hint: it is not using
     your product)
   + Big Data means doing this a lot
   + Netflix prize: $1MM for 10% improvement

* Terminology :slide:
  + Data :: Raw facts, represented in some way
  + Information :: Interperated data with meaning
  + Knowledge :: Information used to achieve some purpose
** Philosiphical :notes:
   + General idea is that there are different levels of abstraction for these
     concepts
   + No hard boundaries

** Phonographic Records :slide:two_col:
   + Data :: Grooves in the record material
   + Information :: Sound heard by a human
   + Knowledge :: Enjoyment of a song
[[file:img/vinyl_record_lp_10inch.jpg]]
** Notes :notes:
   + Generally know how records work?
   + Grooves cut into vinyl, needle moves over them, sound comes out
   + image source: http://www.absurdintellectual.com/2009/04/17/celebrate-record-store-day-saturday-april-18/

** Web logs :slide:
   + Data :: Records of visits to a web page
   + Information :: Summary of user behavior
   + Knowledge :: Understanding shortcoming in a product
** Storage :notes:
   + Data is just 1s 0s on a digital machine
   + At a slightly higher level, data is still just characters in a file
   + Meaning extracted by a human, to get a bigger picture
   + Knowledge is having that mental model of typical user behavior and applying
     it to a purpose
   + Similarity to 5 Whys?

* Web Frontier :slide:
  + Web particularly well suited to analysis
  + Easiest to instrument
  + Already requires high technology
** Alternatives :notes:
   + Medicine, global warming, education may be more "worthy"
   + Because you must interact with central server, each interaction can be
     logged
   + How do you log health history? How many cigarets are being smoked? How many
     hours of exercise happen?
   + Already have programmers building the website, now can put them to use
     building analysis tools or data infrastructure

* Taxonomy of Data Science :slide:two_col:
  + Obtain
  + Scrub
  + Explore
  + Model
  + iNterpret

** Mason & Wiggins :notes:
   + [[http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/][Reading]] in
     which Hilary Mason and Chris Wiggens explain their interpretation of data
     science
   + These are not absolute steps
   + When I taught Data Mining last semester, the book had a different set of
     steps
   + OSEMN
   + Mason Chief Scientist at Bit.ly, many good talks
   + image source: http://www.hilarymason.com/about/

* Obtain :slide:
  + Where to get the data?
  + Services
  + Datasets
** Examples :notes:
   + Even for web, what do you do with the logs across many web servers?
   + How to translate data in logs to information?
   + Services eg: github
   + Dataset eg: homework (microsoft weblogs)

** Common Log Format :slide:
#+begin_src apache_log
127.0.0.1 user-identifier frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] ...
    "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326
#+end_src
   + host ident authuser date
   + request status bytes
   + What are the trade-offs with this format?

** JSON Alternative :slide:
#+begin_src apache_log
127.0.0.1 user-identifier frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] ...
    "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326
#+end_src
#+begin_src json
    {'host': '127.0.0.1',
     'ident': 'user-identifier',
     'authuser': 'frank',
     'date': '10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700',
     'request': 'GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0',
     'status': 200,
     'bytes': 2326}
#+end_src
*** Trade-offs :notes:
   + Developed at a time when logs were used operationally
   + "Easy" to parse, but not standardized with other areas
   + Hard to extend customize

* Scrub :slide:
  + Reconcile inconsistencies:
    + Webserver has the wrong time
    + Determine type of page
    + Changed logging method
** Consistency :notes:
   + Make sure all activity happening in correct time zone
   + If a server had the wrong internal time, add error to logs
   + Bug in timezone handling
   + Hypothertically interested in learning the *type* of resource downloaded
     + 'gif|png|jpg' => image
     + 'pdf|doc|xls' => document
   + used to encode encrypted user\_id, now decrypted
   + even different teams might log user\_id in different ways

* Explore :slide:two_col:
  + Don't under estimate scrolling through data
  + Start simple: scatter plots, histograms
  + Find correlations
[[file:img/1_Vp_screenshot_7_tiny.jpg]]
** Viewpoints :notes:
   + An example program that can plot multi-dimensional records
   + But don't do this advanced stuff first!
   + Just take a look at the data, get a feel for all the variables
     + Are mostly bots hitting your page?
     + What are the unusual patterns?

* Models :slide:two_col:
  + Mathimatical description of a phenomena
  + Main focus of Machine Learning (to some extent Data Mining)
  + Generally, best models are most accurate
[[file:img/yelp_reviews.png]]
** Example :notes:
   + Take the rate of reviews
   + How do you mathmatically describe the behavior?
   + image source: Yelp Factsheet http://yelp.com/press

** Lines :slide:
[[file:img/yelp_reviews-linear.png]]
   + How well does this fit the data?
*** Equation :notes:
    + How to express mathmatically?
    + y = mx + b

** Exponential :slide:
[[file:img/yelp_reviews-exponential.png]]
   + Fit better? How far do we go?
*** Equation :notes:
    + How to express mathmatically?
   + y = mx^2 + b

** Coin Flip :slide:
[[file:img/binomial.jpg]]
   + Coin flips modeled as binomial distribution
** Source :notes:
   + How to express mathmatically?
   http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/04/10/response-to-dr-meiers-answer-9-the-coin-flip-in-the-context-of-climate-modeling/

** Classification Model :slide:
[[file:img/SVM_Example_of_Hyperplanes.png]]
   + Which of these lines best separates the data?
*** Model :notes:
    + Model for how data is distributed into groups, or classes

* Interpret :slide:
  + Business model is working
  + What to bet on a coin flip
  + The characteristics of successful customers
** Apply the information to your domain :notes:
   + Will you run out of money?
   + What's the likelyhood a customer will stay with you next year?

* Analyzing the Real World :slide:
  + How would you gain knowledge of rain forest data?
  + Obtain
  + Scrub
  + Explore
  + Model
  + Interpret
** Steps :notes:
   + Place temperature recorders all over
   + Try to normalize by how long they were in the sun, or an animal sat on them
   + Just scroll through temperatures for a day, then plot on a map
   + Develop estimates on daily temperature (perhaps double sin wave?)
   + Temperature fluxuates less in some areas that are associated with a plant
