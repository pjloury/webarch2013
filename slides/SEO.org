* *Search Engine Optimization* :slide:

* Search Engines :slide:
  + Search helps users find content
  + Producers often want user to find /their/ content
  + Optimize website for discovery by search
** SEO :notes:
   + Producers want to structure their websites to allow search engines to
     easily understand it, think highly of it, and return it in search results

* Optimization :slide:
  + The amount of targeted traffic arriving through "organic" search results
** What are we optimizing? :notes:
   + More people on you site
   + Usually targeted (the Saturn auto website may not care much about astronomers
     much), but first order is just attracting more traffic
   + "Organic" search is that which comes without payment (eg. ads)
   + Once you have more people, need to consider what they're doing next

* Elements of a Search :slide:
  + User :: Has "intent", inputs query terms
  + Search Engine :: Has index, matches sites to query
  + User :: Sees options, clicks one
** What steps do we need understand? :notes:
   + Intent is something like "I want to buy a camera" "How tall is Michael
     Jordan?" "What cars does Saturn offer?"
   + Intent translated to something like "best camera" or "Jordan height"
     "Saturn"
   + Search engines now try to figure out original intent
   + Then match the intent to sites that seem like they address it
   + Does a site address an intent?
     + Use a similar process: analyze the text, figure out intent of site
     + and usefulness

* Matching User Intent :slide:
  + Search engine must figure out intent from queries and page content
  + If words in query neatly match words in content, probably relevant
  + Understand the user, optimize page content
** Ideal Case :notes:
   + SEO as its best used actually addresses the concerns of a user in the
     language they're using
   + Stays focused on what the user wants: don't dilute page contents

* Web Crawler discovery :slide:
  + To be in search index, must be crawled
  + Bots are not people
  + Make pages accessible to bots as well
** pages for Bots :notes:
   + Bots can't see layouts: semantic meaning
   + Bots don't run javascript: keep as much static content on the page (this is
     changing)
   + Bots look at all the data (update meta tags as appropriate)

* Be linked :slide:
  + Incoming links are a vote of confidence
  + Who is linking to you? Why?
  + Who are you linking to?
** Power of links :notes:
   + Are leaders in your area linking to you?
   + Medical advice? Links from Mayo Clinic?
   + Danger! Don't go overboard: buy links, trade links
   + Are you linking to spammy sites?

* Provide data :slide:
  + Pithy, relevant content
  + Useful annotations
  + Make full use of HTML and new formats
** Later :notes:
   + Remember: we want to have discoverable content, have others recognize it,
     and show immediate value to user
   + We'll cover the specifics later

* "Black Hat" :slide:
  + Doing manipulative things to increase rank
  + Buying or planting links
  + Spam
** Huge Problem :notes:
   + For all of these techniques, possible to go too far, or be sneaky
   + Much of dealing with relevance now is counter adversarial SEO

** "Stuffing" :slide:
   + Adding content just for the sake of the bot
   + Every variation of possible queries, no semantic meaning
   + "web architecture, website, web site, web arch, ischool web..."
   + How to avoid: is this useful to a user?
** Details :notes:
   + keyword stuffing in meta tags
   + small pages with just these key phrases, linking to mothership
     + BMW
   + JCPenny got caught, too (reading)
   + If it wouldn't make sense to a user, probably a bad idea

* Summaries :slide:
  + Originally, results summarized from meta tags
  + Now, Keyword in Context (KWIC)
  + Google providing deep links to content
[[file:img/deep-links.png]]
** History :notes:
   + KWIC coined by Hans Peter Luhn 1960
   + Which is more effective depends on context:
     + web pages may be useful
     + legal briefings maybe not?

* Microformats & Microdata :slide:
  + Semantic information can be used to show better summaries
  + Better summaries can help users decide if a result is relevant
  + Different markup methods
** What works for you? :notes:
   + We can use HTML attributes to annotate elements with more semantic
     information
   + Some search engines, like Google, can use these annotations
   + Advanced technique, mostly driven by industry
   + Another reason to separate presentation

** Microdata :slide:
   + [[http://dev.w3.org/html5/md/][HTML5 Specification]]
   + =itemscope=, =itemprop=, =datetime=
   + [[http://www.yelp.com/biz/paseo-seattle][Microdata on Yelp]]
** =itemprop= :notes:
   + aggregate rating
   + Many of these techniques are changing rapidly
   + Important part: Annotation to improve machine understanding, to help human
     understanding

* Microdata Usage :slide:
  + Wrap concept in tag with =itemscope= attribute
  + Type concept with =itemtype= attribute
  + Wrap properties of concept in tags with =itemprop= attribute
** Types :notes:
   + See Schema.org for item types

** Microformat :slide:
  + Convention of using class attribute to annotate
#+begin_src html
<div class="vcard">
   <img class="photo" src="www.example.com/bobsmith.jpg" />
   <strong class="fn">Bob Smith</strong>
   <span class="title">Senior editor</span> at <span class="org">ACME Reviews</span>

** [[http://ogp.me/][Open Graph]] :slide:
   + Allow web page to contain graph information
   + Used by Facebook
   + =meta= tags with =og:= namespace
   + [[http://www.yelp.com/biz/paseo-seattle][Open Graph on Yelp]]
** =og:= :notes:
   + Similar semantic information: location, name, title

* Preventing Crawling :slide:
  + What if you *don't* want to be indexed?
  + Decrease load on server
  + Pages only useful from another context
** Go Away :notes:
   + Spent all this time talking about trying to get noticed, what if you don't
     want to be?
   + redirect links
   + message displayed after signup
   + directly loading advertisements

** =robots.txt= :slide:
   + Requests to bots on crawling
   + =Disallow= : "Please do not crawl this page"
   + [[http://yelp.com/robots.txt][Yelp.com/robots.txt]]
** =User-Agent= :notes:
   + Specify rules for different user agents
   + Only allow a few reputable crawlers:
     + Google, Bing, Yahoo, Internet Archive

** Purely Advisory! :slide:
   + Not enforced
   + Client and Server are decoupled, so server can't control the client
   + Crawlers that ignore =robots.txt= detected and return HTTP error codes
   + Does not make pages private!
   + [[https://www.google.com/?q=login%20password%20filetype:xls][Clever Searches]]
*** No Privacy :notes:
   + Bots can ignore it
   + People can look at it, wonder why you're hiding it

** =nofollow= :slide:
  + =robots.txt= works at the site level
  + At the link tag level, use attribute rel="nofollow"
  + Crawlers may follow them, but won't count them as "endorsement"
  + Useful for user generated content
*** Don't trust the user :notes:
   + Some users are spammy
   + You don't want to be associated with the links they post
   + So tell the crawler not to follow them
   + Also disincentives spam (a little bit)

  + "We are people, not machines."
  + Dedicated to all the people that make a site possible
  + Have some fun
