 + China near the bottom!
 + So much potential growth in the areas that are already surpassing US in raw
   numbers
*** Crazy Part :notes:
    + We're seeing overwhelming numbers, and it only tip of the iceburg
    + 1B Smartphone users
    + 5B "Feature" phone users

* Internet changing lives :slide:
  + Find businesses with Yelp
  + Contact friends on Facebook
  + Share pictures with Instagram
  + Read with Kindle
  + Watch with Netflix Streaming
  + Pay with Square
  + Inspiration with Pinterest

* Mobile Catalyst :slide:
  + Bridges divide between real life and digital
  + Captures and delivers content to /you/
  + Starting to capture context
** Delivery :notes:
   + Mobile can be where you are
   + Often is where you are
   + Delivered to /you/, not your house, not your work

** Context :slide:
   + Location
   + Time (now)
   + Movement
   + Mode
*** Details :notes:
    + Mobile can capture where you are
    + Yelp users search for dinner at dinner time; desktop search for dinner any
      time
    + Waze traffic aggregation
    + Checking work email, calendar, tickets?

* $$ :slide:
[[file:img/yp.png]]
  + Advertising dollars still lagging
** Lag :notes:
   + $14 Billion in revenue, mostly from Yellowpages and Newspapers
   + Where's that money going?
   + Not just mobile ad, but Internet advertising in general

* Not just new users :slide:
[[file:img/india-mobile.png]]
  + Mobile internet soon outpacing desktop
  + Happening faster in emerging markets for a variety of reasons
** Reasons :notes:
   + phones are cheaper, easier to keep on your person
   + essential for communicating

* How to Capitalize :slide:
  + "Shoot ahead of the duck"
  + Be bold
  + Experiment
** Mobile :notes:
   + Trend is obviously toward mobile, but not majority yet: shoot there
   + Keep a fresh outlook, and go 100% toward what you believe
   + Bigger companies need to "invest": be sure where a technology will end up
     before the do something about it.
   + Small companies can try things out, ditch what doesn't work (risky!)

** Example :notes:
   + 2:30 Privacy
   + You may not agree with this statement, but you need to be doing stuff
     bigger companies are uncomfortable with
   + Web Architecture helps you here: no one has to approve your idea (you can
     fail without a net or ceiling)
   + Another example is iPod: evaluate what buttons you need, get rid of the
     rest, use technology to support your idea

* Mobile Software Stack :slide:
[[file:img/mobile-stack.png]]
** Review :notes:
   + OS sites on top of hardware
   + Libraries are used by any higher level for common functionality
   + Services similar to libraries, but they "run" on their own, can contact
     external services
   + UI Widgets are things like buttons, drop downs
   + Apps written to use libraries and services
   + Browsers special apps that essentially can download and run other (web)
     apps

* "Native" Applications :slide:two_col:
  + Written directly with libraries and services
  + Platform specific language: Java, Objective-C
  + Fewer constrains, but less compatibility
[[file:img/path.png]]
** Trade-offs :notes:
   + Directly control UI, make use of phone's specific services
   + OTOH, must directly control UI, make use of the specific services for each
     phone you want to support

** Native Features :slide:
   + Rotation
   + Compass
   + Gyroscope
   + Services (contacts)

* Web Applications :slide:two_col:
[[file:img/yelp-mobile.png]]
  + Written for the browser
  + Platform agnostic
  + Leverages existing technology stacks, but creates opaque dependencies
** Most :notes:
   + Still have to test across devices
   + Constraints are changing, technology like "canvas" allows arbitrary
     drawings
   + Performance trade-off: must rely on browser's ability to render
     efficiently, can't update it for your app.

* Mobile Web is the same :slide:
  + Web Browsers
  + HTTP
  + HTML
  + Javascript
** Still the web :notes:
   + The mobile web is still the web
   + Uses all the same technologies, in the same ways
   + Mobile browser still a browser, with DOM, JS, etc.

* Mobile Web is different :slide:
  + Browsers developed in world of standards
  + Context available
  + Interfaces different
** Differences :notes:
   + Much less variance between CSS, javascript support
   + Means you can push HTML5 to its limits
   + Geolocation
   + Screen size, multitouch, finger "presses"

* Closing the Gap :slide:two_col:
  + Native apps in HTML5
  + PhoneGap
[[file:img/phonegap.png]]
** Details :notes:
  + Write HTML5, Javascript, framework will render it for you
  + Use javascript to call platform specific abilities

* Mobile First :slide:
  + Philosophy: develop your product for mobile
  + Take advantage of mobile features 
  + Contrast: desktop experience, pare down for mobile
** Write the app for a phone :notes:
   + If you're a new project/company, mobile is your edge
   + So focus on your edge, build mobile first
   + Alternative is to make your desktop app, then simplify it for mobile

** Example :slide:

** Benefits :slide:
   + Focus
   + Simplicity
   + Beauty
*** Details :notes:
    + For a desktop app, easy to start copying other desktop apps:
      + login screen
      + cross promotion
      + wizards
    + Instead mobile forces you to focus on the most essential elements... and
      that's all that will fit on the screen!
    + Makes you show how to use it: there's no hover effects for you mouse, just
      your fat fingers
    + Many products are differentiated based on their user experience. Mobile
      has a tendency to draw that beauty out, or make it painfully obvious when
      it is not

** Example :slide:
[[file:img/mobileapp_website.jpg]]

** Drawbacks :slide:
   + Need /some/ story around desktop
   + New platform to learn
   + Limits experience
** Details :notes:
   + Now you have to test all desktop browsers, too?
   + Not many folks experienced with mobile development
   + Are you editing photos? Writing code? Maybe you just can't do that on a
     small screen (though I'd still try designing for a tablet)

** Advice :slide:
   + Make it so easy to use, people start using it by accident
[[file:img/pinterest.png]]
*** Pinterest :notes:
   + Land on the home page, just start scrolling
   + You're using the product! (discovering content)
   + Next step is easy, click one button (repin)
   + Twitter another good example
